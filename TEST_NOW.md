## 🧪 TEST IT NOW - Step by Step

### IMPORTANT: Use "Paste Text" Mode (Not URL!)

### Step 1: Open Frontend
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 2: Click "Paste Text" Button
Click the **📝 Paste Text** button at the top (not the URL button)

### Step 3: Copy This Test Problem
Copy the entire text below:

```
Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices 
of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you 
may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
```

### Step 4: Paste Into Text Area
Paste (Ctrl+V) into the large text area that appears

### Step 5: Click "Generate Explanation ⚡"

### Step 6: Wait Patiently ⏱️

#### What Will Happen:

**Phase 1: Model Download (10-15 minutes)**
- Backend downloads CodeLlama model (13GB)
- You'll see progress in Docker logs
- **THIS IS ONE-TIME ONLY!**
- Browser tab will show "Generating..." spinner

**Phase 2: Model Loading (2-3 minutes)**
- Model loads into RAM (14-16GB)
- Still showing spinner

**Phase 3: Generation (60-90 seconds)**
- AI analyzes the problem
- Generates comprehensive explanation

**Total First Time: ~20 minutes**

#### Monitor Progress:
Open a new terminal and run:
```powershell
docker logs code-gen-backend -f
```

You'll see:
```
Loading model: codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf
Device: cpu
Loading tokenizer...
Downloading (…)model-00001-of-00003.safetensors: 15%|█▌        | 747M/4.98G [00:30<02:48, 25.2MB/s]
```

## ⏱️ What to Expect

### First Generation (Right Now):
```
1. Click Generate → Backend starts downloading model
2. Wait 10-15 min → Model downloads (13GB)
3. Wait 2-3 min   → Model loads into RAM
4. Wait 60-90 sec → AI generates explanation
5. Success! 🎉   → See beautiful output
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: ~20 minutes (ONE TIME ONLY!)
```

### Second Generation (After Model is Downloaded):
```
1. Click Generate → Backend uses cached model
2. Wait 40-70 sec → AI generates explanation
3. Success! 🎉   → See beautiful output
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: ~60 seconds (FAST!)
```

## 📊 Progress Indicators

### In Browser:
- Loading spinner with stages:
  - 🧠 Extracting concepts...
  - 💡 Generating solutions...
  - 🚨 Finding pitfalls...

### In Docker Logs:
```powershell
# Open another terminal and run:
docker logs code-gen-backend -f
```

You'll see:
1. "Loading model: codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf"
2. Download progress bars with percentages
3. "Loading tokenizer..."
4. "Model loaded successfully"
5. "Generating with temperature=0.4"

---

## 🐛 If You See Errors

### Error: "Generation error: ..."
**Likely:** Model still downloading, be patient!

**Solution:** Check Docker logs:
```powershell
docker logs code-gen-backend -f
```

If you see download progress bars → **Wait for completion!**

### Error: "500 Internal Server Error"
**Likely:** Model loading failed or out of memory

**Solution:**
1. Check available RAM: Task Manager → Performance → Memory
2. Close other heavy applications
3. Restart containers:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml restart backend
   ```

### Browser Tab Times Out
**Solution:** Don't close the tab! The download continues in background.
- Keep tab open
- You can check progress in Docker logs
- When ready, try generating again

## ⚡ Alternative: Use Faster Model

If 20 minutes is too long, switch to a smaller, faster model:

### Option 1: Phi-2 (Recommended for Quick Testing)

1. Stop containers:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml down
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file, change line:
   ```
   HF_MODEL=microsoft/phi-2
   ```

3. Start containers:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml up -d
   ```

4. Test again with same steps

**Benefits:**
- Only 2.7GB download (~3 minutes)
- 10-15 seconds generation
- Still excellent quality for algorithms

### Option 2: Phi-3 Mini (Even Faster)

Change `.env` to:
```
HF_MODEL=microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
```

**Benefits:**
- Only 2.3GB download
- 8-12 seconds generation
- Very good quality

## 🏆 For Your Competition/Demo

### Pre-Demo Checklist:

1. **Do ONE test generation NOW**
   - Downloads model
   - Caches it for demo
   - Ensures everything works

2. **Pre-generate 2-3 examples**
   - Easy: Two Sum
   - Medium: Course Schedule
   - Hard: Swim in Rising Water

3. **Save screenshots**
   - Backup in case live demo fails
   - Show quality of output

4. **During Demo:**
   - Show pre-generated examples first
   - Do ONE live generation (60 seconds)
   - Emphasize self-hosted AI

## 💡 Important Reminders

- ⏰ **First time takes 20 minutes** - this is normal!
- 💾 **Model downloads once** - 13GB is cached
- ⚡ **After first time: only 60 seconds** per generation
- 📝 **Use "Paste Text" mode** - URL mode has LeetCode blocking issues
- 🖥️ **Keep terminal open** - to monitor progress
- 🌐 **Keep browser tab open** - during download
