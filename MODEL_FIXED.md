# 🔧 MODEL FIXED!

## ❌ The Problem:
The model identifier `deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq` **does not exist** on HuggingFace.

This was causing the error:
```
"deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq is not a local folder 
and is not a valid model identifier listed on 'https://huggingface.co/models'"
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use Right Now:

### IMPORTANT: Use "Paste Text" Mode!
(URL mode may still have issues with LeetCode)

### Steps:
1. **Wait for model download** (~15 minutes on first use)
   - Check progress: `docker logs code-gen-backend -f`
   - You'll see download progress bars

2. **Once downloaded:**
   - Open: http://localhost:3000
   - Click **"📝 Paste Text"** button
   - Copy problem from LeetCode
   - Paste into text area
   - Click **"Generate Explanation ⚡"**
   - Wait ~60 seconds
   - **Enjoy!** 🎉

## 📝 Example Problem to Test:

Copy this and paste into the app:

```
Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices 
of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you 
may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
```

## 🔍 Monitor Progress:

### Check if model is downloading:
```powershell
docker logs code-gen-backend -f
```

You should see:
```
Downloading (…)model-00001-of-00003.safetensors: 100%|██████████| 4.98G/4.98G
Downloading (…)model-00002-of-00003.safetensors: 100%|██████████| 4.98G/4.98G
Downloading (…)model-00003-of-00003.safetensors: 100%|██████████| 3.02G/3.02G
```

### Check if model is loaded:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model": "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf",
  "device": "cpu"
}
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Faster Model

If you want **faster** results (10-15 seconds instead of 60):

### Option: Use Phi-2 (Smaller, Faster)

Edit `.env`:
```properties
HF_MODEL=microsoft/phi-2
```

Then restart:
```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml restart backend
```

**Trade-off:**
- ⚡ Much faster (10-15 seconds)
- 📦 Smaller (2.7GB download)
- 💾 Less RAM (6-8GB)
- 📊 Slightly less detailed (still good quality)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips:

### For Best Quality (Current Setup):
- ✅ Use CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf (current)
- ✅ Wait for full model download
- ✅ Use "Paste Text" mode
- ✅ Provide complete problem description

### For Speed:
- ⚡ Switch to microsoft/phi-2
- ⚡ Smaller download
- ⚡ Faster generation
- ⚡ Still good quality

### For Competition:
- 🏆 CodeLlama gives best explanations
- 🏆 Pre-generate 2-3 examples
- 🏆 Have them ready to demo
- 🏆 Show off the quality!

---

## ✅ Current Status:

- [x] Fixed model identifier
- [x] Changed to CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf
- [x] Restarted backend
- [ ] Waiting for model download (~15 min)
- [ ] Ready to generate!

---

## 🆘 If Download is Too Slow:

### Option 1: Use Phi-2 (Recommended for quick testing)
```
HF_MODEL=microsoft/phi-2
```
- Only 2.7GB download
- Much faster
- Still excellent for algorithms

### Option 2: Use Even Smaller Model
```
HF_MODEL=microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
```
- Only 2.3GB download
- Very fast generation
- Great for demos
