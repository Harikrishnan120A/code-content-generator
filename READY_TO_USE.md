## 🚀 HOW TO USE (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Open the App
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 2: Click "Paste Text" Button
(Top of the page - the 📝 button)

### Step 3: Copy a Problem
Use this example or any LeetCode problem:

```
Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
```

### Step 4: Paste in Text Area
Ctrl+V or right-click → Paste

## 🔍 Monitor Progress

### Check if Model is Downloading:

**Terminal 1 - Keep this running:**
```powershell
docker logs code-gen-backend -f
```

**You'll see:**
```
Loading model: codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf
Loading tokenizer...
Downloading (…)model-00001-of-00003.safetensors: 23%|██▎       | 1.15G/4.98G [00:45<02:30, 25.5MB/s]
```

### Check Backend Health:

**Terminal 2 - Run anytime:**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model": "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf",
  "device": "cpu"
}
```

## ⚡ Want Faster Results?

### Option: Switch to Phi-2

If 20 minutes is too long, use a smaller model:

**Edit `.env`:**
```properties
HF_MODEL=microsoft/phi-2
```

**Restart:**
```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml restart backend
```

**Advantages:**
- 📦 Only 2.7GB download (~3 minutes)
- ⚡ 10-15 second generation
- 💾 Less RAM (6-8GB)
- 📊 Still excellent quality

**Trade-off:**
- Slightly less detailed explanations
- But still great for most problems!

## 🏆 For Your Competition

### Demo Strategy:

**Before Demo:**
1. ✅ Do ONE test generation (triggers download)
2. ✅ Pre-generate 2-3 example problems
3. ✅ Have screenshots ready as backup
4. ✅ Test with different problem types

**During Demo:**
1. 🎯 Show the beautiful UI
2. 🎯 Highlight "Paste Text" feature
3. 🎯 Generate ONE new problem live (~60 seconds)
4. 🎯 Show pre-generated examples for others
5. 🎯 Emphasize self-hosted AI

**What to Highlight:**
- ✨ Self-hosted HuggingFace model (not OpenAI API)
- ✨ Code-specific training (Meta's CodeLlama)
- ✨ Complete Docker solution
- ✨ Beautiful cyberpunk UI
- ✨ Comprehensive analysis (naive + optimal)
- ✨ Professional-grade output

### Example Problems to Pre-Generate:

**Easy:**
- Two Sum
- Valid Parentheses
- Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Medium:**
- Course Schedule
- Longest Palindromic Substring
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

**Hard:**
- Merge K Sorted Lists
- Word Ladder
- Swim in Rising Water (the one you tried!)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Model Download Too Slow
**Solution:** Switch to Phi-2 (only 2.7GB)

### Problem: Out of Memory
**Solution:** Close other applications, Docker needs 16GB free

### Problem: Generation Takes Forever
**Solution:** Check logs: `docker logs code-gen-backend`

### Problem: 500 Error
**Solution:** 
1. Check if model downloaded fully
2. Restart backend: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml restart backend`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for model loading

### Problem: LeetCode URL Still Fails
**Solution:** Use "Paste Text" mode (recommended anyway!)
